LocalGuru
=========

Find local Linux-guru's on a map. People in need of help with Linux can look up who might be in their neighbourhood to help them out. You can also use it for different purposes, of course.

Currently this project is in production-use at http://buurtlinux.nl/ - so it's mainly Dutch orientated. The code is in need of a lot of TLC, which we hope to receive from the FLOSS communities. 

Requirements
============

 * Apache webserver with PHP 5.3+ (as it is the only tested environment)
 * Knowledge of changing PHP files (as the config is a PHP file and you need to adjust it)
